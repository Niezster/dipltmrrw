            <h2>Europe's Military Spending and NATO</h2>
            <p>European nations are accelerating plans to boost military spending, anticipating reduced U.S. contributions. The EU is considering creating a €500 billion special purpose vehicle, funded through sovereign-backed bonds, and reallocating part of its common budget to defense. NATO members in Europe are discussing raising their defense spending from 2% to 3% of GDP, although this remains below the 5% level suggested by U.S. President-elect Donald Trump.</p>

            <p>While the influx of funds is positive for Europe’s defense industry, which has been expanding since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, there are challenges. The distribution of funds is likely to favor state-owned enterprises and manufacturers of specialized equipment. Supply chain disruptions and rapidly evolving technology add to the complexity.</p>

            <p>The EU’s Act in Support of Ammunition Production, which allocated €500 million to increase annual shell production to 2 million by the end of the next year, is a case in point. According to Jefferies, nearly half of the funds went to state-owned and private companies, with significant shares going to Germany’s Rheinmetall, the UK’s Chemring, and Thales.</p>

            <p>The drive to enhance national security is compounded by the need to address years of underinvestment during peacetime, as well as the reconfiguration of supply chains disrupted by deglobalization. Many defense supply chains rely heavily on small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which often lack the financial stability and access to financing that larger companies enjoy. For example, Italian shipbuilder Fincantieri partners with over 7,000 SMEs, many of which struggle to expand production due to limited financial resources.</p>

            <p>Economic pressures and budget constraints may hinder efforts to significantly increase NATO spending. Currently, a quarter of NATO members do not meet the 2% spending target. Poland, with a projected 4% of GDP in 2024 and aiming for 4.7% in 2025, is among the highest spenders but has a smaller economic output compared to countries like Spain, which contributes only 1.3% of GDP. The UK has pledged to spend 2.5% of GDP on defense next year, although this still falls short of its internal goal of 3.6%.</p>

            <p>While there is strong intent to increase spending and modernize military capabilities, achieving these goals will be challenging.</p>
