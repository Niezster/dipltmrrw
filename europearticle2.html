            <section class="article-body">
                <p>Europe's future security is precariously hanging in the balance. Yet, for many across the continent, the ongoing war in Ukraine feels distant. In Brussels, for example, there’s hardly a sign that war is raging across the eastern borders.</p>

                <p>However, the reality is stark. Russia's aggression has persisted for over 1,000 days, and despite significant losses, Moscow has shown no signs of backing down.</p>

                <p>Even as the U.S. sends military aid ahead of President-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration, Ukraine finds itself on the defensive. Meanwhile, despite President Joe Biden's administration's cautious approach—often too little and too delayed—the incoming administration may present even greater challenges.</p>

                <p>This should serve as a wake-up call for the European Union, underscoring the urgent need for Europe to safeguard its interests, regardless of the direction taken by the U.S.</p>

                <p>As the war has dragged on for nearly three years, the reality is setting in that Kyiv's goal of reclaiming all occupied territories in the short term is becoming increasingly difficult. Russia’s capacity to replenish its forces, with support from Iran, North Korea, and China, is outpacing Ukraine's ability to match it, and its relentless aggression is taking a toll.</p>

                <p>From the West’s perspective, the goal of the conflict has shifted from Ukraine's outright victory to the preservation of its sovereignty.</p>

                <p>Recent history has made one thing clear: Simply negotiating a cease-fire with Russian President Vladimir Putin will not guarantee lasting peace. A cease-fire was previously brokered after Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea and the subsequent conflict in Donbas, but Russia used it as a prelude to ramp up its invasion in 2022.</p>

                <p>Given the current situation, reaching a cease-fire in the near future seems unlikely, especially since there’s little indication Russia is willing to engage in meaningful negotiations.</p>

                <p>What’s more, the new Trump administration will likely seek to bring hostilities to an end by any means necessary—even if it sacrifices Ukraine's ability to defend itself. And when that moment comes, Ukraine and Europe must be included in any peace talks.</p>

                <p>Even if a cease-fire is achieved, it’s uncertain how long such a peace will endure. Wherever the line of separation between Ukraine’s independent territory and the Russian-occupied zones is drawn, it must be strongly defended by more than just Ukrainian forces. Failing to do so will only invite further Russian aggression.</p>

                <p>This is why Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha has recently called for full NATO membership as the only true guarantee of security. In essence, he’s stating the obvious: Without the West’s presence in Ukraine after the conflict ends, there will be no lasting peace.</p>

                <p>However, with President Trump in office, the likelihood of Ukraine’s NATO accession seems remote. The same reasoning that led France and Germany to block Ukraine’s membership bid in 2008—fearing a nuclear war triggered by Putin's ambition to build a new Russian empire—remains prevalent today. But the last 1,000 days have proven that this approach simply doesn’t work.</p>

                <p>If the U.S. and other NATO members remain unwilling to support Ukraine’s NATO membership, is there an alternative solution to end the conflict, preserve Ukraine’s independence, and prevent further destruction or the war from spreading?</p>

                <p>The answer lies in the possibility of a coalition of NATO countries willing to take direct action and secure a future demarcation line between Ukraine and the Russian-occupied territories. If Europe takes the lead, it’s likely the U.S. would support the effort, even without deploying American troops.</p>

                <p>The key challenge here is leadership. The incoming Trump administration will likely be unwilling to take the reins, while the United Nations Security Council is paralyzed by the vetoes of China and Russia. This leaves Europe with the responsibility of ensuring peace on the continent.</p>

                <p>The European Commission’s recent appointment of a commissioner for defense and space marks a historic milestone, and this new development is expected to spur efforts to increase military interoperability and consolidate Europe’s defense capabilities.</p>

                <p>However, with war at its doorstep, the EU requires more than just a well-equipped defense industry—it needs military power to ensure that Ukraine remains independent once a cease-fire is reached.</p>

                <p>The onus is now on Europe’s NATO leaders to engage with the Trump administration in negotiations over any cease-fire deal in Ukraine, ensuring that Kyiv’s voice is heard. If NATO allies are willing to offer physical support to uphold any peace agreement, then there is hope for Ukraine’s continued independence and peace for the rest of Europe.</p>

                <p>This is Europe’s time to step forward and secure its future.</p>
