    <!-- Europe Future Description -->
    <section class="description">
        <p>Europe’s future in a rapidly evolving global landscape is shaped by several key factors. These include economic competitiveness, technological advancements, defense strategies, and geopolitical dynamics. As the world continues to change, Europe faces a variety of challenges and opportunities that will influence its place on the global stage.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Economic Competitiveness Section -->
    <section>
        <h2 class="section-heading">Economic Competitiveness</h2>
        <p class="section-content">Europe's economic growth has slowed since 2000, with per capita disposable income growing at half the rate of the U.S. Former ECB President Mario Draghi describes the situation as "calamitous." To enhance competitiveness, Ursula von der Leyen, at the start of her second term as European Commission President, has proposed policies focusing on improving the bloc's competitiveness amid trade wars and the race to dominate artificial intelligence and green energy. Draghi suggests increasing annual investment by €800 billion and removing barriers for European telecommunications and defense companies. However, political challenges within Europe may hinder these necessary reforms.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Technological Advancements Section -->
    <section>
        <h2 class="section-heading">Technological Advancements</h2>
        <p class="section-content">France is striving to become a global AI powerhouse, with the Station F incubator in Paris nurturing numerous AI start-ups. The country boasts a strong educational system producing highly skilled engineers and an evolving business culture that supports entrepreneurship, making it an attractive location for AI developments. Despite these advantages, the French tech sector faces challenges such as political turmoil and economic uncertainty. Venture capital is becoming more accessible, and open-source models adopted by French AI start-ups could provide a competitive edge. However, some companies, like Pathway, move to the U.S. to be closer to key markets. The French tech sector's ability to thrive amidst these challenges will be tested in the coming year.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Defense and Security Section -->
    <section>
        <h2 class="section-heading">Defense and Security</h2>
        <p class="section-content">Europe is reassessing its defense strategies, especially in light of U.S. President Donald Trump's reluctance to uphold defense commitments and the U.S. prioritizing defense needs in Asia over Europe. European nations are encouraged to build robust, independent defense mechanisms, including replacing U.S. troops in Europe and developing capabilities for high-intensity warfare. The article emphasizes that European security can only be ensured by Europeans themselves, not by relying on the U.S.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Geopolitical Dynamics Section -->
    <section>
        <h2 class="section-heading">Geopolitical Dynamics</h2>
        <p class="section-content">Europe is at a crossroads, and the choices made will determine its voice in the new global order. Democracies are robust when societies keep faith in their strengths, while extremes feed on despair and division. The article suggests that Europe has good reasons to be confident, but the future depends on the decisions made today.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Conclusion Section -->
    <section>
        <h2 class="section-heading">Conclusion</h2>
        <p class="section-content">In summary, Europe's future will be shaped by its ability to enhance economic competitiveness, lead in technological innovation, develop independent defense capabilities, and navigate complex geopolitical dynamics.</p>
